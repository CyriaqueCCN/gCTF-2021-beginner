## Brief

New York is hot, and you are on your way to the office complex. It seems like it is well guarded, even though you are expected under the alias of the assassin, perhaps it will be a better idea to sneak inside the building, unseen? You climb through a window on the side of the building. Inside you spot more guards, quick, hide behind a desk. Now you have to sneak past the guards into the main office.

Challenge: Spycam (hardware)
You manage to find some exposed wires and quickly hook them up to your portable terminal. It seems to be a live feed of the internal CCTV system. If you can manage to decode the signal you might find something interesting, maybe a code or a password to get past the locked door

## Solve

Todo : look for CCTV systems documentation and standards to see if we see something ressembling that
